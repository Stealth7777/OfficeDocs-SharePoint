# Creating and launching a healthy SharePoint portal
A portal is a SharePoint site on your intranet that has a large number of site viewers who consume content on the site. Large organizations can have several portals, for example a company portal and an HR portal. Typically portals have relatively few people who create and author the site and itâ€™s content, and have many more people who read and consume the content.

## Guidance

This set of guidance will walk you through best practices and recommendations before you launch your portal and how to keep your portal healthy.
